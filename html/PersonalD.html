		<!-- Information on how I have been developing myself in the areas listed above-->
		<h2 align="center"> How Have I been Developing Myself in These Areas? </h2>
		<p align="center"> I have been developing myself well as a Enthusiastic person. I always try to act Enthusiastic, <br> I try to take a few minutes
		doing what I love, I used to complain regularly that I “never had time”<br> to pursue my passions, until I heard an artist I admired say, “If you can’t put fifteen minutes into doing<br> what you love, you’re making an excuse.”
		I try to Feed myself well, Move my Body, <br> Practice Self-compassion, Meditate, Avoid energy drains, spend time with enthusiastic people and <br>Learn to say NO.
		<br><br> As a Determined Person, I keep myself motivated and stick to my plan, I learn <br> how to handle my stress, I try to find out my 'why', Value my health, Create postitive<br> 
		habits and always Practicing.
		<br><br> As a Dedicated Person I try not to argue with the plan, know that every day matters,<br> I try to Build a No-matter-what mindset Plan a Routine, Try to Commit and Find pleasure<br> in the hard work.</p>
